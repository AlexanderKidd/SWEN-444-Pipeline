## Overview:
Pipeline is a web app dedicated to Dakota Access Pipeline updates
that exhibits professional, creative, and interactive UX elements.

## Instructions:
Just download the folder "PipelineGoods" and open index.html in your favorite browser.
All of the pages are linked with basic functionality.

This should work across all browsers, although those still using Internet Explorer 8 or
before may find hiccups in functionality (untested, as IE8 mostly deprecated).

**It is also important to note that this is still a prototype, by no means a full web
application.  This is merely for proof-of-concept for Web UX Design**

## Release 2.0 Notes:
-Mock registration/login is possible
-Support globe signing (static location only) available
-News feed comment sections
-Mock scholarly articles
-Mock petitions
-Create a petition button/form updated to be consistent
-Discussion topics with pre-generated talk bubbles and the ability to add your own
-A slew of small touch-ups to the UI mostly based on usability testing feedback

## Release 1.0 Notes:
-Beta has all major pages
-Forms do not work yet, but are able to be played with
