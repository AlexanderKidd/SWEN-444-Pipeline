        <p>It was the best of times, <br>
      it was the worst of times,<br>
      it was the age of wisdom,<br>
      it was the age of foolishness,<br>
      it was the epoch of belief,<br>
      it was the epoch of incredulity,<br>
      it was the season of Light,<br>
      it was the season of Darkness,<br>
      it was the spring of hope,<br>
      it was the winter of despair,</p>
      
    <p>
    we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
    to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, 
    the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest
    authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, 
    in the superlative degree of comparison only.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the 
    throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a 
    fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than
    crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that 
    things in general were settled for ever.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. 
    Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, 
    as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
    blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had 
    heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made 
    for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost 
    had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages,
    as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in 
    originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of 
    events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress 
    of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved 
    more important to the human race than any communications yet received 
    through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her 
    sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness 
    down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of 
    her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such 
    humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, 
    his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he
    had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession 
    of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or 
    sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France 
    and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to 
    death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn
    into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a 
    knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough
    outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there 
    were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered
    with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, 
    which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of 
    the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
    unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
    with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
    that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection 
    to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, 
    and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
    families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
    their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman
    in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised 
    and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character
    of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away;
    the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, 
    and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of 
    the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;
    that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand 
    and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the 
    illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
    gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law 
    fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
    thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court
    drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband
    goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the
    mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.
    In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, 
    was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous
    criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on 
    Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now 
    burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life
    of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had 
    robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon
    the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed 
    by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two 
    of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, 
    trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.
    Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct 
    their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this 
    chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay before them.
